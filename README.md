**Title:** Mechanical root injury triggers threshold-dependent metabolic reprogramming and rhizosphere microbiome assembly

## Abstract

Mechanical injury is a widespread and ecologically relevant stress experienced by woody plants, yet the capacity of the root–microbiome interface to buffer such disturbance through metabolic regulation remains poorly quantified. Here, we conducted an *in situ* manipulative experiment with a root-severance gradient (0, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) on *Populus* trees in a semi-arid field environment to investigate the coupled responses of root exudates and the rhizosphere microbiome. After a 20-day post-severance equilibration period, we characterized root exudate profiles (untargeted LC–MS) and bacterial communities (16S rRNA sequencing) concurrently. Multi-omics integration revealed a non-linear trajectory in rhizosphere reorganization: exudate composition exhibited a distinct threshold-like transition at approximately ~75% root severance, shifting from growth-oriented metabolism to a defense-dominant state (e.g., accumulation of organic acids and phenolics), thereby reshaping rhizosphere chemical niches. This metabolic reprogramming triggered a synchronous reassembly of the bacterial community (Procrustes $m^2 \approx 0.47$, $P = 0.01$), characterized by a stepwise turnover from copiotrophs to stress-tolerant taxa, with a concomitant shift in dominant phyla (e.g., *Proteobacteria*). Network analysis further identified a “defense-recruitment” mechanism, where key metabolites (e.g., citrate) acted as hubs promoting the colonization of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Collectively, these findings uncover a threshold-controlled regulatory mode by which woody plant roots coordinate metabolic reprogramming and rhizosphere microbiome assembly in response to mechanical injury, highlighting a critical boundary at which rhizosphere chemical niches and microbial assembly shift states. These insights advance mechanistic understanding of root injury responses and provide a physiological basis for targeted manipulation of rhizosphere processes in plant stress management and ecosystem recovery.
